# Movie-Rating-Prediction

I have created a sentiment analysis model that will take a review of the viewer as input and output the sentiment associated with it.

pos-if positive.

neg-if negative sentiment is provided by the review.

I have train the model using given data and created a movie review sentiment analysis model.

The data consist of two files:

Train.csv - the training set consists of both review and sentiment pos/neg

Test.csv - the test set consists of only reviews

MovieReview.csv is the final predicted review.

I have used the concepts and techniques of NLP for classification (multinomial Naive Bayes classifier).

# NLP
Natural Language Processing, usually shortened as NLP, is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and humans using the natural language. The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of the human languages in a manner that is valuable.

# multinomial Naive Bayes classifier
The multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is suitable for classification with discrete features (e.g., word counts for text classification).
